Options is a simple C++ wrapper for getopt that makes it easier to
handle command line argument parsing in C++.

See demo.cc and the Makefile for an example of how to use Options.

To install, just run "make" and copy the libOptions.so file wherever
you like to put local shared libraries on your system.

Options is in the public domain.

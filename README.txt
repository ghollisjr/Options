Options is a simple C++ wrapper for getopt that makes it easier to
handle command line argument parsing in C++.

See demo.cc and the Makefile for an example of how to use Options.

To install:

1. Run "make".

2. Copy the libOptions.so file wherever you like to put local shared
   libraries on your system.

3. Copy the Options.hh file wherever you like to put headers.

You can also just add the Options.* files to an existing project for
static linking.

Options is in the public domain.
